# About

A lot of what I’ve learned and achieved was the result of rising to the occasion when incredible people pushed me and placed their trust in me. It was through opportunities that my family, friends, and mentors gave me that I was able to complete my bachelor’s in computer science at the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://cs.washington.edu).

I like to make music in my spare time, [here](https://soundcloud.com/tam-dang-630323427/tracks) is where I do that.

I’m currently learning French, reading through [Le Petit Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Prince) and [Agenda Noir — 1986](https://www.amazon.com/Agenda-1986-Roland-Sorbier-Thierry/dp/B0046Y0P4C). I speak at the A2 level and would like to be fluent someday.

# Experience

**Machine Learning Intern** — [Xevo Inc.](https://xevo.com) (Summer 2018)
As a software engineer on the AI team at Xevo, I was part of an effort to introduce voice recognition into Xevo Marketplace. For my summer-long project, I implemented [OneNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05149): Alexa Brain’s and MSR’s joint SLU model for domain, intent, and slot prediction. I made the model ready to be used on novel data by also implementing an NLP suite for their framework, including tokenization, text normalization, trainable word embeddings using Tensorflow, and other features standard to a natural language processing pipeline.

**CSE 341 Teaching Assistant** — [ University of Washington, Seattle](https://washington.edu) (Sp' 2016, Au' 2017, Au' 2018)
I was a teaching assistant for the programming languages course at the UW, which teaches functional programming in Racket and SML and compares their nuances against imperative-style programming. I graded assignments and exams, held office hours along with a weekly recitation section, and handled the initial auto-grading and distribution of grading work to other TAs. I also monitored assignments for cheating via [MOSS](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/).

**Software Engineering Intern** — [PayScale Inc.](https://payscale.com) (Summer 2017)
I was part of the conversion and retention (CAR) team at PayScale, where I worked on a MOOC (massive online open courseware) recommendation system based on consumer survey data. Built with ReactJS and ASP.NET, users can see course recommendations appear on their dashboard
