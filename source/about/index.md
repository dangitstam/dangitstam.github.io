<h1>About</h1>


A lot of what I’ve learned and achieved was the result of rising to the occasion when incredible people pushed me and placed their trust in me. It was through opportunities that my family, friends, and mentors gave me that I was able to complete my bachelor’s in computer science at the <a href="https://cs.washington.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science &amp; Engineering</a>.With an interest in NLP and the intent to do machine learning for a living, I returned to the Allen school to pursue my master’s degree.


I like to make music in my spare time, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/tam-dang-630323427/tracks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> is where I do that.


I’m currently learning French, reading through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Prince" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Le Petit Prince</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Agenda-1986-Roland-Sorbier-Thierry/dp/B0046Y0P4C" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Agenda Noir — 1986</a>. I speak at the A2 level and would like to be fluent someday.
